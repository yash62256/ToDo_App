Steps to run application:

1. Make sure you have Postgresql installed on your system.
2. Create a user, it's password and database, and enter them in files:

    i.  server.js and   
    ii. toDOItem.js (in models folder)
       (See comments)
3. Open terminal and Change directory to server.js's file's directory.
4. Uncomment 'line 54' from 'toDoItem.js' file (models folder), if running the application first time on your system.  
5. Type 'node server.js' and enter 
6. Comment back line 54 from 'toDOItem.js' file from models folder.
    (Otherwise it will replace the old table with a new one and all your data will get destroy)
7. Use Postman to test the application using 'localhost:5500/' and see file app.js
